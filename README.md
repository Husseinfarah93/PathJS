# PathJS
PathJS is a web application to help visualise pathfinding and maze generation algorithms. Seeing is believeing but it's also learning. 
A lot of the times algorithms are hard to internalise and understand so PathJS makes it easier to understand how common algorithms behave.

## How it works

1. Users can drag around a start and end node and set them in place.
2. Users then can choose an algorithm from the navigation bar 
3. Users can optionally choose a maze or draw walls by dragging the mouse
4. Lastly users can press visualise and either visualise the full exploration map or a partial real time exploration map
